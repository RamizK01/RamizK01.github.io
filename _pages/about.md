I graduated from McMaster University back in 2019 with a Bachelors of Health Sciences focusing on Biomedical Discovery and Commercialization. I pursued my Masters at the University of Toronto in Biotechnology specializing in Digital Health Technology. Over my academic career I have built a diverse skillset in domains such as pharmaceutical commercialization, data science, bioinformatics, and biostatistics. I am always eager to keep learning and expand my skills while creating some sort of impact for patients lives.
